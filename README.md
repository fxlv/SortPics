Find all the Images and Videos in specified directory and move them to destination directory.
Organize by Year and Month in the destionation directory.

## Why?

The use case is quite simple.
I have tons of images and videos that get automagically uploaded to my OneDrive from my phone.

This is great, but eventually it gets too big and hard to navigate, therefore this simple organizer can bring some order to the chaos.

## Usage

Find all images and videos from year 2015

```
.\SortPics.exe -y 2017
```

Find all Images and videos from March 2016
```
.\SortPics.exe -y 2016 -m 3
```

You get the idea...
